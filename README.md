# Blood Sugar Trend Analysis
The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between physical activity and blood sugar levels with the aim to develop a predictive model to predict blood sugar levels based on physical activity and other factors.
The following data sources were used:
- Blood sugar data from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), particularly the Dexcom G7
- Manual recording of insulin intake via injections
- Manual recording of carbs consumed each day
- Physical activity data from an Apple Watch 6
Findings from this investigation will be used to make more informed decisions fueling and blood sugar management during physical activity.
